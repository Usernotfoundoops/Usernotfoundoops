# 🚀 Welcome to My GitHub Galaxy!
Hey there, I'm Pravin, a physics enthusiast who's been zapped by the machine learning bug! 🌌 I just conquered Machine Learning for Physicists 2024 by Florian Marquardt, wielding JAX like a lightsaber to slice through neural networks, convolutional nets, and reinforcement learning. Now spreading my domain toward Deep Learning and Quantum Bits. Ready to explore the physics coding lab? Let's dive in!

### 🧠 What I'm All About
- Mission: Blending physics with ML to solve mysteries of the physics, one neuron at a time. Construct complex QuBit networks with less error rate.
- Fun Fact: I once tried to teach a neural net to predict my handwriting. Spoiler: It works flawless.

### 🌟 Featured Projects
- ML for Physicists 2024: My playground of neural nets, autoencoders, and RL experiments from the course. Check out my spin on backpropagation and physics-inspired ML!

- I'm currently learning QuTip and would love to collaborate.
- Coming Soon: A wild project using RL to tame a chaotic pendulum or maybe an autoencoder to decode quantum states. Stay tuned!

### 🛠️ Tools in My Lab
- Code: Python, JAX, FLAX, OPTAX, TensorFlow, QuTip
- IDM: Pycharm, Google Collab.
- Inspiration: The original course repo here: https://github.com/FlorianMarquardt/machine-learning-for-physicists/tree/master/2024
